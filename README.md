# Pathfinding and Deep Learning

This repository contains two assignments developed for the course **AI Game Development**, during my third year of university.

### About the Projects

The goal of these assignments was to implement **search algorithms** and **Deep Learning** in **Unity** to create more complex NPC behaviors. Below are the details of each practice:

1. **Practice 1: A\* Pathfinding and Horizon Search**  
   The objective was to guide a character through a maze to find the exit using the **A\* algorithm**. Additionally, there is a scene that contains enemies in the maze, making the character chase them using the **Horizon Search** method before finding the exit.

2. **Practice 2: Q-Learning**  
   The second assignment involved using **Q-Learning** to make a character evade another NPC for as many iterations as possible on a randomized map.

### Features
- Implementation of AI algorithms in Unity.
- Use of A* Pathfinding, Horizon Search, and Q-Learning for NPC behavior.
- Randomized environments for dynamic gameplay.

### Technologies
- **Unity**
- **A\* Pathfinding**
- **Q-Learning**
- **Deep Learning**
